"""Local Python Executor (enhanced).

This module provides a safer wrapper around smolagents.LocalPythonExecutor
with improved exception handling and a few helpful tools registered with
the executor to make debugging executed code easier.

Key improvements:
- Register a few helper utilities via send_tools so user code can use
  them for reporting (e.g. `format_exc`).
- More robust extraction of stdout/stderr/exit codes from the executor
  result object, tolerant to different versions of smolagents.
- Detailed stderr on unexpected exceptions including full traceback.
- Structured logging for operational visibility.
